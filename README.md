## Summary

With the rapid development of global internet, how to measure the evolution
and influence in society’s information network is becoming a hot issue. This paper
aims to build models to analyze the evolution and relationship between spread
speed and qualified news.

Task (a): a formula is given to define qualified news. Local Regions Network
for early three periods and Global Network for lately two periods are build respec-
tively to show the evolution process based on consideration of different features in
these 5 periods.

Task (b): percent of different information sources in 2012 year is predicted by
TimeSeriesmodel. Basedonglobalnetworkmodelin(a), aRandomGraphicmodel
with formula for nodes and edges is constructed by Monte-Carlo simulation to
predict today’s communication situation, the relationship between spread speed
and qualified news displays that the averaged relative error between reality and
prediction is nearly 8.9%.

Task (c): Time Series model is used again to predict the ratio change of infor-
mation sources in 2050. re-calculated the numbers of diffusive nodes and time, the
network capacity to describe speed and qualified news can be obtained. In addi-
tion, two index of averaged shortest distance and connected strength in 2050 show
that the communication capability increase 25.81% and 23.22% than in 2012.

Task (d): delivery probability for information with and without public guidance
are formulated respectively. Degree of Approval, defined as the proportion who
agree with a piece of information, is used to measure the change caused by public
interest. Curves shows that lower initial approval degree will tend to more less but
higher initial approval degree will increase to 1.

Task(e): Four factors that we should discuss are divided into two classes. Using
model in (b), we found three factors of information value, message ˛ a´ rs form and the
topology of network would speed up the information spreading. Using model in
(d), we found the factor people’s initial bias would influence public opinions.
